# How to contribute

Patches and third-party contributions are essential for keeping J2V8 great and
helping to evolve this library. There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow so we have a chance to keep on top of things.

## Code contributions

Code contributions are greatly appreciated. We currently target V8 3.26, so
all contributions must link against that version of V8. Code contributions
should be accompanied by a set of unit tests. All tests are written in Java
and executed using JUnit. See `src/test/java` for examples.

## JNI layer

The C++ layer should be kept as thin as possible. This results in a more
verbose JNI layer, but it also moves the more complicated logic to Java.

## J2V8 core

J2V8 core contains the basic V8 bindings, represented as a hierarchy of
Java Classes. The core contains all the classes found in `com.eclipsesource.v8`.
J2V8 core should have no external dependencies other than JRE 1.6 and the JNI
layer.

## J2V8 Utils

J2V8 utils contains a higher level of abstraction and provides a number of
utilities for using J2V8 in a Java System. The J2V8 utils contains all
the classes found in `com.eclipsesource.v8.utils`. The J2V8 utils should
have no external dependencies other than JRE 1.6, and J2V8 core.
